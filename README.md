# OpenBMC-Metrics

In order to run the tools here you will need to get your gerrit "Username" from "settings" in your gerrit account profile. Put this in the tool for USER in the format "Username@project-url" and you should be good. The code also makes the assumption that your gerrit instance is running on default port 29418, if not, you will need to change that to the port your gerrit is using.
